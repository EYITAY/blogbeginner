Just create a new repository and upload your project directly.
or alternatively
Steps:
Create a directory on the local file system.
Create a repo on Github.
Select Clone "Clone or download" on Github, copy the link
In Visual Studio Code, sect File -> Add Folder to Workspace -> Select the newly created directory
Select Terminal Window
In the window, type:
git config --global user.name <github userID>

git clone <URL from github link copied earlier>
That should be all that's required.  any newly created file should be available on github after stage/commit/push.
  
Thanks
